# Movie Rating Prediction Project (TASK-3) 

This project aims to predict movie ratings using machine learning techniques based on features like year, duration, and number of votes.

## Overview

The project uses a dataset of Indian movies from IMDb to build a predictive model for movie ratings. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.

## Key Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Machine learning model to predict movie ratings
- Model evaluation and interpretation

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Project Structure

1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory data analysis
3. Feature engineering
4. Model building (Random Forest Regressor)
5. Model evaluation
6. Result interpretation

## Results

- The model achieves an R-squared score of 0.074, explaining 7.4% of the variance in movie ratings.
- Mean Squared Error: 0.891
- Feature importance analysis shows 'Votes' as the most influential feature, followed by 'Year' and 'Duration'.

## Visualizations

- Movie Ratings over Time (scatter plot)
- Ratings by Genre (box plot)
- Correlation Heatmap
- Actual vs Predicted Ratings (scatter plot)

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate additional features like genre, director, or budget information
- Experiment with more advanced models or ensemble methods
- Increase the dataset size for potentially improved accuracy
